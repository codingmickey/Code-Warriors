# Code Warriors
We present an De-Fi music app named as `Audious`
## ðŸ’¡ The problem Audious solves
All the times, we know that the real owner of a particular song does not remain the "OWNER" of the song. Usually, massive apps like youtube or spotify buys it. Huge personalities will be attracted to our website because they will own their Songs and eventually sell the users if a particular user is interested to buy it. The user can listen to the songs and also buy it using Tezos wallet
## ðŸš« Challenges we ran into
We ran into a couple of challenges during the hackathon. Creation of a new song is not possible as of now though we aim to do that in our future aspects.
